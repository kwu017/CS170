# CS170 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

## 8-Puzzle
Program that solves the 8-puzzle with three different heuristics
  1) Uniform Cost Search
  2) A* with Misplaced Tile Heuristic
  3) A* with Manhattan Distance Heuristic
  
## Machine Learning
Feature Selection with Nearest Neighbor using various kinds of searches
  1) Forward Selection
  2) Backward Elimination
  3) My own "special algorithm"
     - uses forward selection & alpha/beta pruning
     - improves speed
